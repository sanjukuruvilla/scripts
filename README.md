''' # Running the Bash Script

To run the Bash script named `script.sh`, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Script**: If you haven't already, download the `script.sh` file from this repository.

2. **Open Terminal**: Open your terminal or command prompt. You can usually find it in your applications or by searching for "Terminal" (Linux/Mac) or "Command Prompt" (Windows).

3. **Navigate to the Script's Directory**: Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you downloaded the `script.sh` file. For example:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/script-directory '''

1. **Execute the Script**: Run the script using the bash command followed by the script name. Make sure the script has executable permissions. If not, you can grant them using the chmod +x script.sh command. Then execute it like so:

bash script.sh

2. **Follow User Prompts**: The script may prompt you for input during execution. Follow the prompts and provide any necessary information as instructed.

3. **Enjoy the Results**: Once the script completes its execution, you should see the desired outcome. If any errors occur, they will be displayed in the terminal.

That's it! You've successfully run the Bash script using the bash script.sh format. Feel free to explore the script's functionality further or reach out for assistance if needed.
